# Student Diary Manager

## Overview
This is a simpler version of previous [attempt](https://github.com/zEleceed/Monthly-Comment-Generator) on making it

Student Diary Manager is a Python-based console application that allows users to manage daily comments for students stored in individual text files. This tool is useful for teachers or administrators who want to keep a simple, append-only log of student performance, behavior, or any other daily notes.

## Features

- Create new student diary files on-the-fly.
- Append daily comments with automatic date-stamping.
- View all comments within a student's diary.
- Organize student diary files neatly in a specified directory.

## How It Works
- Create a Student Diary: Simply input '+' when prompted, and provide a student name. The diary will automatically be created if it doesn't exist.
- Append a Comment: Choose a student by number and write your comment. It will be timestamped and saved immediately.
